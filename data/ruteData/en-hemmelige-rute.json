The bell would be sounded to summon the Viborg citizens to assist in fighting the fire. The warning bell was originally installed in the tower of Church of St. Hans at Nytorv. In 1584, however, it was moved to the tower of Church of St. Ib in the Northern part of Viborg. And, finally, in 1613, it was installed in the Belfry of the Cathedral's north tower. Since 1984, the warning bell has been exhibited in the Cathedral's small museum in the cellar vault under the Cathedral's south tower.",

The cellars housed the town's jail, and this was also where the town's fire engine was kept. In 1889, Viborg Museum took possession of this fine baroque building which has housed Skovgaard Museum since 1980. This cobbled, lush little museum garden with its trimmed hedges and pollarded small-leaved linden was laid out behind the museum in the 1970s. The centrepiece of the garden, Edith Ludvigsen's bird fountain from 1984, was created on the basis of the marsh plant, water chestnut. In the garden's southwest corner, you can see Mogens Bøgild's relief, depicting the murder of King Erik Klipping which took place in Finderup Lade in 1286. You can learn more about this piece of art if you select the route Memorial stones and Monuments. The soft murmur of the bird fountain and the delicate light sifting through trough the foliage turn this garden into a peaceful and lush oasis, right in the centre of Viborg.",

Latinerhaven represents the last large undeveloped plot left after the violent city fire which, in 1726, laid waste half of Viborg – including the four nobleman's estates once situated where the gardens are now located. The name, Latinerhaven (the Latin Garden), came about because the grammar-school's headmaster would later use this plot as his private garden. The approx. 200-year-old 'Headmaster's Gazebo' still stands on the corner of Sct. Mogens Gade and Sct. Mathias Gade. This green urban garden was laid out in different sections – for instance, herbaceous perennials and spring and summer flowers. There is also a small section with aromatic plants for aquavit. The gardens further have monuments to the poet of the heath, St. St. Blicher, and a memorial plaque to the ornithologist H. Chr. C. Mortensen, also known as, Birdwatcher Mortensen. You can learn more about this by selecting the route, Memorial stones and Monuments. Next to the grammar school's old gym, you find Løvebrønden (the Lion's Well), designed by the local architect, Frederik Jensen, in commemoration of the centennial of the savings bank, Viborg Bys og Omegns Sparekasse, in 1928. In 1935, the bank expanded, and the well was in the way. It was therefore donated to the beautification of the city and set up in Latinerhaven.",

For nearly 200 years, from 1824 to 2004, this elegant baroque building housed successive lord lieutenants (stiftamtmænd) of the Viborg diocese. A lord lieutenant was in charge of the secular administration of a diocese. Completed in 1758 as a private dwelling, the house is considerably older than the lord-lieutenant institution. The house was built 32 years after the building preceding it fell prey to the flames in the great fire. The sandstone plaque on the house states Janus Friedenreich and Anne Margrethe Lind, husband and wife, to have been the builders. The side wing facing St. Sct. Hans Gade contains traces of a medieval string of stalls – a row of small integrated rental accommodations which would typically have comprised craftsman's workshops and dwellings for day labourers and the poor. The building material would have been the red mediaeval large bricks, still barely visible in the painted masonry of the gateway towards the square. In the courtyard, to the left, there is an approx. 150-year-old semi-circular conservatory – originally intended as a cart shed for the lord lieutenant's horses and carriage.

The shop would have been facing the street and the square; and, if one walked through the gateway, there would have been store- and warehouses and stables. Due to successive backyard clearances over the year, many such backhouses have now disappeared. Framed by old as new buildings, the intimate atmosphere of the small courtyards is still felt – in particular behind the houses along Nytorvgyde and behind 5 Nytorv. If you enter this gateway, you'll find a small timber-frame building dating back to 1730. If you walk up to the end wall, you'll see three iron rings. Today, their position may seem relatively high, but this is because of recent years' subsiding terrain. A hundred years ago, they would have been used by farmers from the surrounding area, who would tie their horses here when coming to town to buy such goods as they could not produce themselves.",

That night, on March 18 in 1674, there was an elevated atmosphere in Salomon Gerber's cellar – in the alehouse, Paradiset, at lower Nytorvgyde. Four noblemen, Johan Rantzau, Caspar Brockenhuus, Otto Bille and Christoffer Gersdorf, had begun their evening drinking snapps in Svaneapoteket's snapps cellars, at Nytorv. Their next stop was Paradiset where they continued to drink heavily. But, as the old saying has it: 'when ale is in wit is out'. This was exactly what happened in this instance. A heated discussion ensued, one word led to another, and the four hotheads stumbled out into the alley, accompanied by two servants, carrying portable lamps. In the flickering light of the lamps, swords were crossed and what should turn out to be a duel to the death was fought. The two pairs of combatants fought the best they knew, but in the end Bille and Gersdorf had to lay down their arms. Badly wounded they slid to the ground. In haste, both were carried to Svaneapoteket where Bille expired. Later, in his home, Gersdorf also died from his wounds.",

The building material comprises red bricks and loads of varied ashlar stonework from some of the twelve parish churches, torn down in 1529. The projecting bay serves a dual purpose. It lets in more light to the room behind as well as providing a better view of the street. If you enter the gateway, you'll see that the side wing constitutes yet an example to illustrate that much of the building material was originally used for a church building. Here, you'll spot the remains of two semi-circular so-called tympanums – normally found above the west-facing doors of a church. One depicts the face of an angel. The other tympanum – only half of which has been preserved – depicts Christ with his right hand raised in blessing. The tympanum's left side, featuring the Greek letter A, – signifies Alpha and the sun. The missing half would have featured an O for Omega and a moon.

There are many ways of being remembered – sometimes willingly and, at other times, unwillingly and unwittingly – which was the case in this instance. Miss Ellen Billetoft, who taught languages at Viborg Katedralskole from 1938 to 1969, lived in the yellow house close to the rose garden of the Hans Tausens Minde grounds. Miss Billetoft was nicknamed 'Billen' (which is beetle in English). In the 1970s two boys, Jens Christian and Gerd, who attended nearby Østre Skole, snuck into the gardens. Having fallen out with ”Billen”, they now scratched the words ”Billen er dum” in one of the beeches – using a screwdriver. A direct translation would be 'Billen is stupid' – however, had the boys been English schoolboys, they would most likely have scratched something along the lines of 'Beastly Beetle'. It is said that time will heal all wounds – and, in this case, this will actually hold true as, for every year that passes and for every year the beech grows, the disrespectful words wounding both tree and teacher will become increasingly illegible. One day, they will have disappeared entirely – and the same will probably be true with respect to the memory of Miss Billetoft.",

In Viborg, the deep sighs are said to be drawn by the prisoners before being sentenced before the High Court.
